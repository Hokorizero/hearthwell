<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Hearth Well is a mod about construction. Without leaving your house
	you will get the materials you need to build everything you want.
	Between crafting simple blocks and building multiblock structures,
	you will never be idle.
</p>
<p>
	The objectives of this mod are that you build the machines you need 
	(and hopefully have fun doing it) to give purpose to your home space,
	and that everything is as simple as possible, without complex GUI's or numbers,
	while still having enough diversity to keep you engaged to progress through the mod.

through the mod, and will give you a general idea of how most crafting mechanics work.<br>

			The first items you're going to need require wood in a world of stone.
			That's why you have that seed in your hand. Hold the right button and point it at the floor to sprout life.

The Precision Grinder: A multiblock structure that allows
you to grind your materials into other ones.
Requires a Grinding Wheel to be inserted, but not all operations are available
for every grinding wheel.
Be careful not to grind big stacks of materials or the grinder can jam
and the grinding wheel can jump out.<br>
In a more common world, the Precision Grinder can be used as an early form of resource multiplication
as it will slightly increase the yield of mined ores.<br>
Requires 100 Energy per Operation.
