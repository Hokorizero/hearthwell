##### A minecraft mod about never leaving your base.
Through many new crafting mechanics, a progression system, and the building of machines and multiblocks, everything will be available!

Also includes several lifestyle conveniences along with many cosmetic blocks and items, both of which enrich the experience of progressing through the mod and hopefully make it fun and worth it.

Already includes many customization options in the config files, including changing and adding recipes for most of the new crafting mechanics.
