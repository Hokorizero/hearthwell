# Hearth Well

##### A minecraft mod about never leaving your base.
Through many new crafting mechanics, a progression system, and the building of machines and multiblocks, everything will be available!

Also includes several lifestyle conveniences along with many cosmetic blocks and items, both of which enrich the experience of progressing through the mod and hopefully make it fun and worth it.

Already includes many customization options in the config files, including changing and adding recipes for most of the new crafting mechanics.

To get started in Hearth Well you need two wooden pressure plates. Place one on each hand. Then, while looking directly up and sneaking, say a prayer to the gods containing the words "poor", "please", "send", "book", "gods", and smash the pressure plates together with right click! If the gods are merciful they will send you a book explaining the concepts of the mod.
