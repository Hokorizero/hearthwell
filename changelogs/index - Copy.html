<h2>0.2</h2>

<h3>[ NEW STUFF ]</h3>
<p>Update: to enable the hwell_recipes.json file and to be able to change recipes, you must now enable "customRecipesEnabled" in the config!
</p>
<p>Added a new machine block, the Setter. When an item passes through its range, the setter will try to place that block down.<br>
 - It has a default range of 4 blocks, which can be increased and decreased by placing Moonstone or Azurite (or Smooth Azurite) blocks in the remaining 5 blocks that surround it (each Moonstone and Azurite Block moves change range by 1).<br>
 - The range may also be moved further away, in the same direction, by placing Crystal Blocks the same way (each Crystal Block moves changes range by 2).<br>
 - The Setter requires 15 energy per operation.<br>
 - The default range may be changed in the config.<br>
</p>
<p>Added two new Stabiliser blocks, and tweaked the existing one's recipe.<br>
 - There are now three stabilisers: the Light Stabiliser, the Stabiliser and the Heavy Stabiliser;<br>
 - They will prevent blocks near cores from dropping by 33%, 66% and 100% respectively.<br>
</p>
<p>Added a new source of Power: the Power Crystal<br>
 - Requires 3 parts to craft: the Nucleous, the Relay and the Screen.<br>
 - Possible Nuclei: Snow block, Mysterious Rod, Blaze Rod<br>
 - Possible Relays: Stone, Azurite, Moonstone, Soulsteel Block<br>
 - Possible Screens: Glass, Crystal, Nether Crystal<br>
 - Can be crafted with different materials for each part, so has crafting combinations<br>
 - Can be right clicked in the world to place them. Will provide power for nearby machines.<br>
 - The Power Crystals have three traits: power, range and purity.<br>
 - Power simply means more total Power available. Range is also simply the range at which a Power Crystal can deliver power.<br>
 - Purity affects power lost by distance. More purity means less power lost when charging a machine from a distance.<br>
 - Different parts affect the traits differently.<br>
</p>
<p>Added a new block: the Charger<br>
 - Charges Power Crystals.<br>
 - Requires a Multiblock Structure.<br>
 - Right click to insert the crystal, then throw items with Potency into the machine and the potency will be extracted and inserted into the crystal.<br>
 - Some items might not be fully consumed. The unpotent remainder will be spat out from the top of the charger.<br>
</p>
<p>Added configuration for the Nourisher: energy consumption, range, cooldown and target selection;<br>
Changed Boxer no longer requires redstone to work. Instead, a redstone signal will prevent it from working.<br>
Changed many default power consumptions to reflect changes in power usage.<br>
Changed the Loot Kit Producer to require energy.<br>
</p>
<h3>[ BALANCE ]</h3>
<p>Misterious Bushes now grow much slower near other Mysterious Bushes<br>
Reduced number of boxes a boxer spawns to 32. This may be changed in the config.<br>
ALL Entities will now, by default, be prevented from traveling to the nether by any means. This may be changed in the config.<br>
</p>
<h3>[ BUG FIXES ]</h3>
<p>Fixed a bug with the Dust Picker Holder where sometimes a player was unable to retrieve dust pickers. (FINALLY!!)<br>
Fixed bad localization when interacting with other mods.<br>
